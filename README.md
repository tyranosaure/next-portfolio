# Ayoub's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I showcase my latest projects and skills.

## Technologies Used

Here are the technologies I used to develop my portfolio:

- **Next.js:** A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Sanity:** A headless CMS for managing content that offers a great developer experience and flexibility.
- **Framer Motion:** A library for creating smooth animations and interactions in React.
- **GitHub:** A platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
- **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying and hosting web applications with ease.

I chose these technologies because they allowed me to develop a fast, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio that is easy to maintain and update. I enjoyed working with them and look forward to exploring more technologies in the future.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to run my Next.js project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tyranosaure/next-portfolio-manager.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd next-portfolio-manager
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

5. Open your web browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

 to view the running application.

That's it! Now you can explore the project and make changes as needed.
